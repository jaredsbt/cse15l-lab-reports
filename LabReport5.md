The error I receive is : Incorrect file type. Must be java . When I run this command.

## TA Response 
Hello, Anushka! I see that your problem is you are not inputting the correct bash command in the terminal. try running: bash grade.sh (GIT URL REPO). 

submitting a java file. Please make sure the extension of your file is .java and the file name is ListExamples ---> (ListExamples.java)
