## Student Post 
Hello, I am anushka and I am having problems submitting my files to the grader. The error I receive is : Incorrect file type. Must be java . The file I am submitting is README.txt

## TA Response 
Hello, Anushka! I see that your problem is you are not submitting a java file. Please make sure the extension of your file is .java and the file name is ListExamples ---> (ListExamples.java)
